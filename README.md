AICore_Project_Rock_Paper_Scissors

In the first milestone I have used Google Teachable machine to take images for my project. I have taken multiple images to represent classes Rock,Paper,Scissors and Nothing and the computer appears to recgonise these reasonable successfully. I have now downloaded the model and made my initial commit/push to github

I have used some model code that operates the camera on my laptop and uses the taught model to generate probabiilities. Separately, I have created code with several methods to resemble the logic for a rock, paper, scissors game and in the last milestone I hope to combine these things to be able to play Rock, Paper Scissors against the computer using my webcam.

4th July 2022: I have created code to score the game and stop when either the user or the computer gets to 3 wins. I have completely reordered my code to include a lote more specific methods. There are functions for start_camera, start_game, stop_video, get_prediction, get_winner and timer. 

In this reordering, I feel I have learned more about organising workflows, classes and how to call methods using self. This has helped me reorder my code more efficiently and more easily identify where errors are
